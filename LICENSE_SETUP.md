# License Setup Documentation

## Overview

This website uses a dual-licensing approach:
- **Code (Apache 2.0)**: The source code is open source with patent protection
- **Content (CC BY-SA 4.0)**: Articles and notes require attribution

## What's Been Added

### 1. Footer Component (`components/Footer.tsx`)

A footer that appears on every page with:
- Copyright notice with current year
- Link to CC BY-SA 4.0 license
- Brief explanation of license terms

**Location**: Bottom of every page

**What users see**:
```
¬© 2024 Boris Kayiranga. All content licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.
You are free to share and adapt this content with attribution and under the same license.
```

### 2. License Files

Three license files have been created:

#### LICENSE
- **Covers**: Source code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, configurations)
- **Type**: Apache License 2.0
- **Allows**: Free use, modification, distribution of code with patent protection

#### LICENSE-CONTENT.md
- **Covers**: All written content (articles, reading notes)
- **Type**: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0)
- **Requires**:
  - Attribution when sharing
  - Same license when adapting
- **Allows**:
  - Sharing and remixing
  - Commercial use
  - Adaptations

### 3. Updated Documentation

**README.md** now includes:
- Clear license section
- Explanation of dual licensing
- Links to both license files

## CC BY-SA 4.0 Explained

## Customization

### Change Your Name

In `components/Footer.tsx`, line 7 (currently set to "Boris Kayiranga"):
```tsx
¬© {new Date().getFullYear()} Boris Kayiranga. All content licensed under{' '}
```

In `LICENSE`, line 189 (currently set to "Boris Kayiranga"):
```

```

### Change License (Not Recommended)

If you want to use a different Creative Commons license:

**Options:**
- **CC BY 4.0**: Requires attribution only (no ShareAlike)
- **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**: Non-commercial use only + ShareAlike
