# License Setup Documentation

## Overview

This website uses a dual-licensing approach:
- **Code (MIT)**: The source code is open source
- **Content (CC BY-SA 4.0)**: Articles and notes require attribution

## What's Been Added

### 1. Footer Component (`components/Footer.tsx`)

A footer that appears on every page with:
- Copyright notice with current year
- Link to CC BY-SA 4.0 license
- Brief explanation of license terms

**Location**: Bottom of every page

**What users see**:
```
¬© 2024 Your Name. All content licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.
You are free to share and adapt this content with attribution and under the same license.
```

### 2. License Files

Three license files have been created:

#### LICENSE
- **Covers**: Source code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, configurations)
- **Type**: MIT License
- **Allows**: Free use, modification, distribution of code

#### LICENSE-CONTENT.md
- **Covers**: All written content (articles, reading notes)
- **Type**: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0)
- **Requires**:
  - Attribution when sharing
  - Same license when adapting
- **Allows**:
  - Sharing and remixing
  - Commercial use
  - Adaptations

### 3. Updated Documentation

**README.md** now includes:

```

### Change License (Not Recommended)
